             <strong>Bhagat Singh</strong> born on <strong>27th September 1907</strong> at <strong>Banga, Lyallpur District,Punjab Province, British India.</strong>
              was a charismatic Indian revolutionary  who participated in the mistaken murder of a junior British police officer in what was to be retaliation 
              for the death of an Indian nationalist. 
              <br><br>
              Borrowing the ideas from <strong> Bolshevism </strong>and<strong> anarchism </strong> he electrified a growing millitancy in India in the <strong>1930s</strong> and prompted urgent introspection within the <strong> Indian National Congress </strong> 
              nonviolent but eventually successful campaign for India's independence.
              <br><br>
              <strong> In December 1928 </strong>Bhagat Singh and an associate <strong> Shivaram Rajguru </strong>,both members of a small revolutionary group, the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association,<strong>shot dead a 21 year old british police officer 
               John Saunders,in Lahore Punjab,in what today is Pakistan</strong>.
              <br>
              <br>
             Bhagat Singh's father and his uncle <strong>Ajith Singh </strong>were active in progressive politics, taking part in the agitation around the <strong>Canal Colonization Bill in 1907</strong>, and later the <strong>Ghadar Movement of 1914‚Äì1915.</strong>
             was a prominent member of the <strong>Hindustan Republican Association(HRA)</strong>and was probably responsible, in large part, for its change of name to <strong>Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) in 1928</strong>.
             <br>
             <em>Bhagat Singh had become the symbol of the new awakening among the youths</em>.<br><br>
             Nehru acknowledged that Bhagat Singh's popularity was leading to a new national awakening, saying: <em>"He was a clean fighter who faced his enemy in the open field ... 
             he was like a spark that became a flame in a short time and spread from one end of the country to the other dispelling the prevailing darkness everywhere"</em>.<br><br>
             <br> <br>
             <strong>Bhagat Singh remains a significant figure in Indian iconography to the present day</strong>.His memory, however, defies categorisation and presents problems for various groups that might try to appropriate it.
             <br>
            The place where Singh was cremated, at Hussainiwala on the banks of the Sutlej river, became Pakistani territory during the partition. <b> 17 January 1961</b>, and was 
             <em>transferred to India in exchange for 12 villages near the Sulemanki Headworks.</em>
              <br><br>
             The youth of India still draw tremendous amount of inspiration from Singh.He was voted the <strong> "Greatest Indian" </strong>in a poll by the Indian magazine India Today in 2008, ahead of Bose and Gandhi.During the centenary of his birth, 
             a group of intellectuals set up an institution named Bhagat Singh Sansthan to commemorate him and his ideals.<br><br><br>The Parliament of India paid tributes and observed silence as a mark of respect in memory of Singh on 
             <strong>23 March 2001 and 2005</strong>.
             In Pakistan, after a long-standing demand by activists from the Bhagat Singh Memorial Foundation of Pakistan, the Shadman Chowk square in Lahore, where he was hanged, was renamed as Bhagat Singh Chowk.<br><br>
              This change was successfully 
             challenged in a Pakistani court.<strong> 6 September 2015 </strong>, the Bhagat Singh Memorial Foundation filed a petition in the Lahore high court and again demanded the renaming of the Chowk to <b>Bhagat Singh Chowk!</b>.
