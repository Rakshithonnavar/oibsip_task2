                   <h3>This is a tribute to Bhagat Singh,an Indian social revolutionary!</h3>
             <!-- 23 March 1931 -->
             <p>
             <strong>Bhagat Singh</strong> born on <strong>27th September 1907</strong> at <strong>Banga, Lyallpur District,Punjab Province, British India.</strong>
              was a charismatic Indian revolutionary  who participated in the mistaken murder of a junior British police officer in what was to be retaliation for the death of an Indian nationalist. 
              He later took part in a largely symbolic bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail, which—on the back of sympathetic coverage in Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a household name in the Punjab region, 
              and after his execution at age 23 into a martyr and folk hero in Northern India.<br><br>
              Borrowing the ideas from <strong> Bolshevism </strong>and<strong> anarchism </strong> he electrified a growing millitancy in India in the <strong>1930s</strong> and prompted urgent introspection within the <strong> Indian National Congress </strong> nonviolent but eventually successful campaign for India's independence.
              <br><br>
              <strong> In December 1928 </strong>Bhagat Singh and an associate <strong> Shivaram Rajguru </strong>,both members of a small revolutionary group, the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association,shot dead a 21 year old british police officer John Saunders, in Lahore Punjab,in what today is Pakistan.
